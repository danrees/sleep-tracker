# Sleep Tracker #
## Introduction ##

This is just a small [Meteor|http://www.meteor.com] application
that I've built to track my son's sleep schedule.

## Controls ##

There are several 'sleep events' that I've defined:

Sleep: When sleep actually starts

Wake: When sleep ends

Crib: When placed in crib

Abort: When sleep has failed to occur and giving up occurs

Feed: When fed

There is a quick event form that lets you record an event with a timestamp
of the current time, or you can enter events in the long form that lets you
specify the time.

If you've entered an even incorrectly you can delete it with the Del button
in the table.

No edit currently, if I need the functionality I'll add it in.


## To Do ##
- Still need some sort of filtering/paging on the results table
- Probably would like to start by showing a day at a time
- Eventually would like to be able to chart it
